- Now I'm doing researches about **Deep Learning** at the Institute Of Semiconductors,CAS, mostly about <u>Dereverbeation, Music Generating and Speech Enhancement.</u>

- I love all the beautiful things, enjoy composing music and coding.

I'll keep on updating my story, my thoughts, and sharing the skills I have attained with a genuine heart.
